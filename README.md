# Logger crate

This project was developed as a learning experience. I am fully aware that there
are many other logging crates out there, but where is the fun in that? As a hobbyist
it seemed like a good idea at the time.

## Acknowledgement

A lot of the functionality has been inspired by, and even copied from, the JDK's
`java.util.logging` package. Though whether or not it will become a _full_ port or
not, only time and my level of interest, will tell. Remember, "learning experience"?

Anyway, have fun.\
