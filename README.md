# FLogging crate

`Flogging` provides an easy framework for logging.

Log entries can be sent to the console (stdout or stderr), file, memory log, or a custom handler. They
can be formatted in various layouts: ISO8601, Simple, Unix TimeStamp, or a custom
layout.

Macros and public functions are provided, with the macros being the simplest method
of operation.

There are several levels for logging at:

- SEVERE,
- WARNING,
- INFO,
- CONFIG,
- FINE,
- FINER, and
- FINEST

There are even two special settings:

- ALL, and
- OFF

## ** WARNING **

Version 0.5.0 **BREAKS** the custom formatter API.

If you have _not_ yet started developing your own versions of the formatter, then this will _NOT_ affect you. The Public API is currently backwards compatible to version (0.4.1).

For the rest of you, please check out `FormatType::Custom` and view the **Change Log**.

**Note:**\
Version (0.6.0) is backwards compatible with version (0.5.0). Therefore it has the same warning as above. It is recommended that any use of version (0.4.X) be bumped to atleast (0.5.0), fixing the minor issue, as this will continue into all subsequent version updates.

## Acknowledgement

This project was developed as a learning experience. I am fully aware that there
are many other logging crates out there, but where is the fun in that? As a hobbyist it seemed like a good idea at the time.

A lot of the functionality has been inspired by, and even copied from (at the API level), the JDK's `java.util.logging` package. Whether or not it will ever become a _full_ port, only time and my level of interest, will tell. Remember, "learning experience"?

## What's in a name?

`Flogging`, as-in, "Flogging a dead horse", or "Just another f\*ing logger". As I wrote above, there are _many_ other logging crates around. This is just my learning spin on a very well covered tool.

## What's in a number?

As per the requirements of the crate site (<https://crates.io/>), I am using
Semantic Versioning in accordance with the specifications documented
on this site: <https://semver.org/>.

Therefore, once I am certain that the API is stable, I'll release v1.0.0.

## Coverage Report

I have included the latest test coverage report, generated by `llvm-cov`.
It is located here: [coverage report].

## Change Log

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Final word

Having said all that, with jokes aside, this is a fully working project. One that I
hope others will benefit from. If not just using it, then perhaps learning from
the source code displaying the various solutions to the problems involved in providing the
functionality.

Anyway, have fun.\
