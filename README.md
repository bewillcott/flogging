# FLogging crate

`Flogging` provides an easy framework for logging to the console and/or a file.

It has both macros and public functions, with the macros being the simplest method
of operation.

There are several levels for logging at:

- SEVERE,
- WARNING,
- INFO,
- CONFIG,
- FINE,
- FINER, and
- FINEST

There are even two special settings:

- ALL, and
- OFF

## Acknowledgement

This project was developed as a learning experience. I am fully aware that there
are many other logging crates out there, but where is the fun in that? As a hobbyist it seemed like a good idea at the time.

A lot of the functionality has been inspired by, and even copied from (at the API level), the JDK's `java.util.logging` package. Whether or not it will ever become a _full_ port, only time and my level of interest, will tell. Remember, "learning experience"?

### What's in a name?

`Flogging`, as-in, "Just another f\*ing logger", or "Flogging a dead horse". As I wrote above, there are <i>many</i> other logging crates around. This is just my learning spin on a very well covered tool.

Anyway, have fun.\
