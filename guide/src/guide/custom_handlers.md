# Custom Handlers

Why would you want to create your own handlers?

Well, you tell me!

OK, I suppose I can provide a few reasons. How about:

- sending log entries to:
  - remote system log servers
  - another program (local or remote) for live analysis, or some other processing
- storing log entries:
  - in a specific file format (xml, json, csv)
  - in a database

Actually, the "file format" option above may only need a custom formatter. I'll leave that decision up you, if you need one of them.
