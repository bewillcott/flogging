# Wrap Up

Right ... Now we are done. We have our (hopefully) working custom handler, that can be used in our project.

Of course, I expect that your requirements will be more complex.

However, by following this reasonably straightforward process, you should not have too many challenges in getting your custom handler working.

Remember, it's in the `publish()` method that all the real work is done. The rest is just setup.
